    <p><b>flavors and construction:</b> lemon pound cake with vanilla whipped cream frosting, berry filling, and kumquat peel + lemon garnish</p>
    <p><b>design inspiration:</b> had leftover frosting and berry filling even after going all out on my birthday cake. also had lemons. boom, lemon berry cake! kinda ran out of frosting toward the end but i liked the colors. attempted some drop line type action and it didn't go very well, the frosting texture was suboptimal. while i was making this it was raining and it felt very magical</p>

        <li>gluten free!</li>
        <li>on the dense side, my bad for choosing a pound cake recipe lol</li>
        <li>we don't have a zester so i peeled the lemons and just chopped up the bits really small. i think this worked pretty well?</li>
