    <p><b>flavors and construction:</b> vanilla chantilly cake with whipped cream frosting and berry compote filling</p>
    <p><b>design inspiration:</b> wanted to do a green and pink cake but ended up with a more turquoise-y green than i was expecting, rolled with it. also i had so much fun cutting strawberries into stars for the galentine's cake i couldn't resist doing it again here lol. for a final touch of whimsy i added a little rabbit/totoro-like guy with my favorite googly eye sprinkles.</p>
