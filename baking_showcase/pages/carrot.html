    <p><b>flavors and construction:</b> carrot cake with cream cheese frosting and raisins as garnish. no mix-ins bc i don't fw nuts in my cake unlike some of u guys</p>
    <p><b>design inspiration:</b> treva and i have been obsessed with ornate romantic-looking cakes with a lot of drop lines and ruffles so that was the vision. i did the edge and treva did the drop lines, executed beautifully i think. we started running a bit low on frosting toward the end tho lol but were able to make a kind of star-like design on the top? she was beautiful and a mammoth ofc with just frosting, but we decided to add some raisins for fun and i think it is just so cute</p>

    <p><b>other notes:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>gluten free!</li>
        <li>so moist omg would highly recommend <a href=https://www.inspiredtaste.net/25753/carrot-cake-recipe target="_blank" rel="noopner noreferrer">the recipe</a> we used</li>
        <li>we don't have a grater so i peeled the carrots into peel bits and treva went nuts cutting them up with scissors inside our measuring cup. crazy method but it actually worked quite well.</li>
    </ul>
