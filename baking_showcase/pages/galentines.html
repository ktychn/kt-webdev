    <p><b>flavors and construction:</b> chocolate cake with cream cheese frosting and strawberry filling</p>
    <p><b>design inspiration:</b> ofc we had to attempt a heart-shaped cake for valentine's day. honestly i think it turned out pretty well! the frosting vision was ofc pink but things escalated quickly, as they tend to whenever i am involved in frostin a cake. had a LOT of fun cutting strawberries into vaguely heart-shaped pieces which turned into cutting them into stars which turned into just covering the entire cake with berry bits. cuz why not.</p>
