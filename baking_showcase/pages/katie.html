    <p><b>flavors and construction:</b> chocolate cake with peanut butter frosting and banana filling</p>
    <p><b>design inspiration:</b> envisioned a mossy/leafy/nature-y cake (inspired by pinterest ofc). honestly some of the best swirly frosting i think i've done, i was so happy with how this turned out. the shades of green are just so nice. jane assisted with the creature placement and added the little sprinkle trail which i love!</p>

    <p><b>other notes:</b>
    <ul>
        <li>gluten free!</li>
        <li>on the dense side, maybe didn't mix the batter hard enough?</li>
        <li>made a bonus smaller cake with the extra batter and frosting. added berries and i think this color combo is also so nice!
